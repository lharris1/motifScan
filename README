INPUT
   refSeq - reference sequence file, in FASTA format
   querySeq - query sequence file, in FASTA format
   mot1 - first motif to search for 
   mot2 - second motif to search for 
   winSize - allowable sequence gap between two motifs
   revComp Y/N - if ON, program will look for motifClusters with reverse complements
                 of the input motifs, in addition to the motifs as entered
                 (O configures OFF, 1 configures ON)
   wobbleBase Y/N - if ON, tells program to look for motifs in accordance to the 
                    conventional base pair wobble rules:
                         W -> "A,T"
                         S -> "C,G"
                         K -> "G,T"
                         M -> "A,C"
                         Y -> "C,T"
                         R -> "A,G"
                         N -> "A,C,G,T"
                    (O configures OFF, 1 configures ON)

SEARCH ALGORITHM 
 	1. scan refSeq for mot1
       	record location, call it mot1_found
 	2. look for mot2 w/in range of +/- winSize of mot1_found on refSeq
        record location, call it mot2_found
 	3. if mot2_found on refSeq:
 	    go to mot1_found on querySeq
 	    is mot1 there (or within +/- winSize) on querySeq?
 	        if not, go to step 4
 	        if yes, scan for mot2 w/in range of +/- winSize of mot2_found on querySeq
 	        	output mot1_found 
 	4. else, back up to step 1, continue scanning from mot1_found on refSeq
