INPUT
   refSeq - reference sequence file, in FASTA format
   querySeq - query sequence file, in FASTA format
   mot1 - first motif to search for 
   mot2 - second motif to search for 
   winSize - allowable sequence gap between two motifs

SEARCH ALGORITHM 
 	1. scan refSeq for mot1
       	record location, call it mot1_found
 	2. look for mot2 w/in range of +/- winSize of mot1_found on refSeq
        record location, call it mot2_found
 	3. if mot2_found on refSeq:
 	    go to mot1_found on querySeq
 	    is mot1 there (or within +/- winSize) on querySeq?
 	        if not, go to step 4
 	        if yes, scan for mot2 w/in range of +/- winSize of mot2_found on querySeq
 	        	output mot1_found 
 	4. else, back up to step 1, continue scanning from mot1_found on refSeq
